# Indieling
Indieling is a React/Redux music web application which utilizes the excellent Jamendo API and displays and plays tracks from independent artists. The app gives you the opportunity to browse, search through and play albums, tracks, artists and filter them based on popularity over various time spans. Play any song with a click or add an entire album to your listening queue.
